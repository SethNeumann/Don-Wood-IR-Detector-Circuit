Don Wood offered this circuit for an optical detector based on an IR emmitter/detector pair and
it used a segment of Dr. Chubb's SMC-12 as a substrate.  This is the same circuit without the
extraneous bits and and with dedicated pads for the pot and for a limiting resistor for the
emitter.  Terminal names stay close to the originals.  This ***may*** be a cost effective or
easier option for those needing a small number of detectors.  It will work as an ambient light
detector without an emitter but you are responsible for controlling ambient light and ensuring
illumination is consistent.
